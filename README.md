# Portfolio Template Documentation

This README contains some basic information about the layouts of the portfolio and how to navigate it 
if you're new to this.

Before you get started on editing the files I would suggest you have the following prerequisites:

- NodeJS
- React
- Typescript

After we can run the following to start a local host of the portfolio:

npm run build
npm run dev

# App.tsx

To start off you can nagivate to this file where the overall structure of the porfolio is shown 


# Last bug: 
hamburger menu bug where it does not display on top of other divs
